ABSTRACT    = {Large-scale models require substantial computational resources for analysis
and studying treatment conditions. Specifically, estimating treatment
effects using simulations may require a lot of infeasible resources to
allocate at every treatment condition. Therefore, it is essential to
develop efficient methods to allocate computational resources for
estimating treatment effects. Agent-based simulation allows us to generate
highly realistic simulation samples. FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing
Epidemiological Dynamics) is an agent-based modeling system with a
geospatial perspective using a synthetic population constructed based on
the U.S. census data. Given its synthetic population, FRED simulations
present a baseline for comparable results from different treatment
conditions and treatment conditions. In this paper, we show three other
methods for estimating treatment effects. In the first method, we resort to
brute-force allocation, where all treatment conditions have an equal number
of samples with a relatively large number of simulation runs. In the second
method, we try to reduce the number of simulation runs by customizing
individual samples required for each treatment effect based on the width of
confidence intervals around the mean estimates. In the third method, we use
a regression model, which allows us to learn across the treatment
conditions such that simulation samples allocated for a treatment condition
will help better estimate treatment effects in other (especially nearby)
conditions. We show that the regression-based methods result in a
comparable estimate of treatment effects with less computational resources.
The reduced variability and faster convergence of model-based estimates
come at the cost of increased bias, and the bias-variance trade-off can be
controlled by adjusting the number of model parameters (e.g., including
higher-order interaction terms in the regression model).},
